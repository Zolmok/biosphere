* Biosphere
  biosphere is largely a learning project.  I'm trying to learn Rust
  and I've been slowly working through my scripts rewriting them all
  in Rust as a learning experiment.  This app takes as input a JSON
  file that describes what apps to install on various systems. You
  could think of it like a really terrible ansible.

* Quick start
#+BEGIN_SRC shell 
  $ git clone git@github.com:Zolmok/biosphere.git
  $ cd biosphere
  $ cargo install --path .
#+END_SRC

* Configuration format
  The configuration is a JSON file with the following format

#+BEGIN_SRC json
// apps.json
{
  "operating_systems": [
    {
      "name": "linux",
      "versions": [
        {
          "types": ["pop", "ubuntu"],
          "package_managers": [
            {
              "meta": {
                "command": "sudo",
                "args": ["apt-get", "update"]
              }
            },
            {
              "meta": {
                "command": "sudo",
                "args": ["apt-get", "install", "-y"],
                "apps": [
                  "clamav",
                  "curl",
                  "emacs",
                  ...
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
#+END_SRC

To run and install the apps from your configuration

$ biosphere --config /path/to/apps.json
#+END_SRC bash
