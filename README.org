* Biosphere

Biosphere is a simple CLI tool to bootstrap development environments across multiple operating systems.

It's primarily a learning project: I'm teaching myself Rust by converting old scripts into something more structured and robust. You can think of it as a (very minimal) alternative to Ansible or Brewfiles — but JSON-based and written entirely in Rust.

Given a JSON config file that specifies which apps to install per OS/distro, Biosphere will:
- Detect your OS (and Linux distro, if applicable)
- Look up relevant commands and apps
- Run them (or simulate with `--dry-run`)

* Quick Start

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ git clone git@github.com:Zolmok/biosphere.git
$ cd biosphere
$ cargo install --path .
#+END_SRC

* Running It

To install apps based on your configuration file:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ biosphere --config /path/to/apps.json
#+END_SRC

To preview what would be executed (no changes made):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ biosphere --config /path/to/apps.json --dry-run
#+END_SRC

* Configuration Format

Your configuration file (`apps.json`) should look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "operating_systems": [
    {
      "name": "linux",
      "versions": [
        {
          "types": ["pop", "ubuntu"],
          "commands": [
            {
              "meta": {
                "command": "sudo",
                "args": ["apt-get", "update"]
              }
            },
            {
              "meta": {
                "command": "sudo",
                "args": ["apt-get", "install", "-y"],
                "apps": [
                  "clamav",
                  "curl",
                  "emacs"
                  // ...
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
#+END_SRC

Each command entry has:
- a `command` (e.g. `sudo`)
- optional `args` (e.g. `["apt-get", "install", "-y"]`)
- optional `apps`: a list of packages appended to `args` for each app not already installed

This is a learning tool — but if you find it helpful, have suggestions, or want to add support for more distros (macOS, Arch, Windows WSL, etc.), PRs are welcome!
